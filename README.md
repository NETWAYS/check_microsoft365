## Setting up Access

In order to work correctly you need the correct permissions and configuration within Azure, to grant the plugin proper
read-only access to the resources.

The following step-by-step instructions will help you to setup this configuration.

### App Registration

In Azure, withing the Azure Active Directory, search for the key word **App registrations** and add a new registration
with a meaningful name for the app registration like `check_microsoft365`.

If the app registration was successfully, it should appear under the tab **Owned applications**. pen the app details and
navigate to the section **Certificates & secrets**, add a new client secret.

### Give app read access

Now the `check_microsoft365` **App Registration** needs *ServiceHealth.Read.All* access to fetch monitoring values via
the Microsoft Graph API.

In Azure, navigate to the previous registered App and search for the key word `API permissions`. Then click
on `Add a permission`
and select on the right-hand side `Microsoft Graph`. According to that click on `Application permissions` and
search/select for
`ServiceHealth.Read.All`, which allows the app to read your tenant's service health information, without a signed-in
user. More over, if issue messages are required in the plugin output, you may also have set the `ServiceMessage.Read.All` permission.
